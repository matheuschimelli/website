For Brasileis.com.br i used the following tech stack:

Currently I'm also bulding a new scientific social platform for sharing and publishing high quality scientific papers. It's open source and are beeing build using Golang. I'm tryng to use the least Javascript I can, due to the fact that i want it to be a platform for easy access for everyone, doesn't matter the internet quality.
